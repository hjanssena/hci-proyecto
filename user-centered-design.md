# User-Centered Design (UCD) & Lean UX Methodology

We are integrating **User-Centered Design (UCD)** principles within a **Lean UX** framework. This approach prioritizes rapid, iterative learning over heavy documentation, focusing on shortening the distance between a requirement and its validation.

Generally, each iteration of the UCD approach involves four distinct phases. First, as designers working in teams, we try to understand the context in which users may use a system. Then, we identify and specify the users’ requirements. A design phase follows, in which the design team develops solutions. The team then proceeds to an evaluation phase. Here, you assess the outcomes of the evaluation against the users’ context and requirements, to check how well a design is performing.

## The Lean UX Cycle
Our implementation transforms the traditional UCD process into a continuous, high-speed loop:

* **Think (Context & Requirements):** We begin by defining assumptions based on the coordinators' actual workflow.
* **Make (AI-Driven Prototyping):** We accelerate the "Design Solutions" phase by using **AI-generated high-fidelity prototypes**. Instead of waiting for static wireframes, we immediately produce interactive UI views that reflect complex requirements.
* **Check (Tangible Validation):** We can then validate the functional prototype with our end user. This allows for immediate "Evaluate against requirements" sessions where we observe how users interact with the implemented functions and use cases.

## How we are applying UCD
For this project, we have four monthly deliveries and for each delivery we will have four sprints. This being the first delivery, we already have defined the scope of our project, studied our end user and their process from existing documentation and defined the usability attributes we have to emphasize for the project.

#### Second delivery
Based on the documentation and our current assumptions, we will create a first functional high-fidelity prototype using AI and document how it meets our set expectations from the first delivery. We will also produce a testing guide and a validation checklist for the tests we will perform for the next delivery.
**Deliverables:** Prototype (source code and documentation) and testing guide.

#### Third delivery
For this delivery we will start performing tests with the users and documenting the whole process. Our documentation will include the validation checklists, comments from the users and an analisis of how our assumptions may or may not have been spot on. Additionally, an improvement plan for the prototype based on our results will be made for the next delivery
**Deliverables:** Testing results, results analisis document and prototype improvement plan.

#### Fourth delivery
The planned improvements will be implemented to the prototype and once we are done we will validate once more with our end user. We will produce the same documentation as the third delivery and compare how the design and UX has improved in-between cycles.
Deliverables: Testing results, results comparison analisis, improved prototype (source code and documentation).

### UCD Team roles
* **Product Lead:** Defines the "Think" phase, manages the project scope, and ensures all features align with the FCA staff's administrative needs. Also acts as the project's spokeperson.

* **UX Designer:** Owns the "Make" phase, utilizing AI to generate high-fidelity prototypes that meet your consistency and accessibility requirements.

* **Technical Lead:** Oversees the implementation of core features and the underlying infrastructure required for the prototype. Ensures all technical tools and system requirements are fully operational to support the project lifecycle.

* **UX Researcher:** Executes the "Check" phase by leading user validation sessions, managing checklists, and drafting the improvement plans.
