<h3>Reflection #1 – On AI Tools</h3>
The companies that make AI tools and models promise a lot, but we have to remain skeptical of their output and their reach.  Having said that, i believe that LLM’s have already fundamentally changed the way UX/UI is made by having extremely rapid prototyping as an option to test out features and different layouts with the end-users and stakeholders.

Although the output that is generated is, in my opinion, still not production ready, and still needs to be very carefully reviewed, <mark>it’s way more than good enough to build a proof of concept</mark> to give everybody that is involved in the project an idea of how everything will look like when the project is finished, that way the team can pivot in the very early stages.

One drawback that’s very evident is that the designs it produces are very standard and generic, so if the project calls for something more creative, the tools will come short to making the idea a reality since the LLM’s are trained on already existing data. That is something that is also true with no-code alternatives, so it’s to be expected of all tools. <mark>If you want to build test a creative idea, you still need to put in the work.</mark>

<h3>Reflection #2 – HCI, Usability and UX</h3>
HCI is the research that wants to understand user needs and wants, usability measures those needs and wants and UX is a broader perspective that includes usability, user satisfaction, the emotions of the user and the overall experience of using a system or application.

Having said that, for the FCA project, one example of usability is the ease of registering to an event. If the process is confusing or not clear enough, we would not be meeting that usability requirement and we should work to improve it. On the other hand, when we examine that same process from an UX point of view, we include the same usability metrics but also how the user feels throughout the process, all the tasks they have to perform outside of the system to complete it and the security that the task is succesfully completed without error.

One UX feature that could be implemented (in an ideal perfect world) is integrating the user’s SICEI account to validate their status in UADY. That way the user feels safer as it gives credibility to the process and makes the process way easier for UADY staff, students and graduates.
