The 2024 article Usability Heuristics for Metaverse by graduates from the University of Petra, Jordan mentions: "Although heuristic evaluation was created in the era of desktop computers, the basic method is still useful today. This is because analysts can change the list of heuristics they use during their studies."

Earlier the following is stated: "It should be noted that these heuristics have to keep up with new technological advancements, as well as changing expectations from users, hence ensuring a positive user experience (UX) within the metaverse."

Even though the idea of a Metaverse is close to the coffin, it shows how modern technologies that are known for its unique difficulties can benefit from comparing functionality with these 10 essential heruistics made years ago.
