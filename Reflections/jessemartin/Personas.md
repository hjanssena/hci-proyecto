The most interesting element that the personas methodology provided to me during our project were the needs that need to be covered on a software solution. The article User Personas as a Shared Lens for Library UX
says the following: "User personas are one such tool, helping both communicate UX findings and knowledge of users, and helping guide the design process by ensuring that the right questions are being asked and users remain the central focus in decision making".
This philosophy of a two-way communication to reach a mutual understanding is easy in theory, but in our project we needed to pull papers on social science to read the cualities people prioritize on similar systems and
to turn them into a persona that will justify our future design choices. To collect these items, we used Perplexity to sort demographic data on the role of a school coordinator and then read these sources to find key
takeaways that shaped pretty much the whole persona.
